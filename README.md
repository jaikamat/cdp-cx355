### Usage

### Web Interface Deep Dive

The web interface provides a comprehensive control system for your Sony CDP-CX355 with several distinct functional areas:

#### Transport Control Panel
Located at the top of the interface, provides immediate access to all basic playback functions:
- **Play**: Starts playback of the currently selected disc
- **Stop**: Stops playback and returns to ready state
- **Pause**: Toggles pause/resume for current track
- **Next/Previous**: Skip between tracks on the current disc
- **Power**: Toggles CDP-CX355 power state (with visual feedback on LED matrix)

#### Disc Collection Management
The heart of the interface, featuring a smart progressive loading system:

##### Progressive Loading System
- **Initial Load**: Interface starts with "Load First 25 Discs" button
- **Pagination**: Loads discs in batches of 25 to prevent memory overflow
- **Progress Tracking**: Button shows "Load Next 25 Discs (50/300)" to indicate position
- **Memory Efficient**: Only loads what's needed, supporting full 300-disc capacity

##### Per-Disc Controls
Each disc entry provides multiple interaction options:
```
Disc 1: [Title Text Field] [Play] [Auto-Discover]
```

- **Title Field**: Editable text input (16 character limit) for custom disc names
- **Play Button**: Immediately selects and plays the specific disc
- **Auto-Discover Button**: Queries the CDP-CX355 for the actual disc title stored in its memory

##### Auto-Discovery Feature
The auto-discovery system communicates directly with your CDP-CX355 to retrieve disc titles:
- **Real-time Feedback**: Button shows "Discovering..." during operation
- **Success Indication**: Shows "Discovered!" then auto-refreshes the page
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" if communication fails
- **Automatic Storage**: Successfully discovered titles are immediately saved to EEPROM

##### Bulk Operations
- **Update All Titles**: Saves all modified disc titles to device memory in one operation
- **Form Persistence**: Changes are held in browser until explicitly saved
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple disc updates simultaneously

#### Real-time Status Feedback
- **LED Matrix Display**: Shows current operation status, IP address, and connection state
- **Web Interface Updates**: Dynamic button states and progress indicators
- **Console Logging**: Detailed S-Link communication logs available via Serial monitor

### API Reference

The device exposes a RESTful API for programmatic control:

- **Record Size**: 19 bytes per disc (2 + 16 + 1)
- **Addressing**: Zero-indexed internally, 1-indexed for user interface
- **Memory Layout**: Sequential records starting at EEPROM address 0

### User Experience Workflows

## Advanced Features & Debugging

### LED Matrix Status Indicators

The Arduino Uno R4 WiFi's built-in LED matrix provides visual feedback throughout operation:

#### Connection States
- **WiFi Search Animation**: Displays during initial WiFi connection
- **IP Address Display**: Shows device IP address once connected
- **Connection Status**: Scrolling text indicates "wifi connected"

#### Operation Feedback
- **S-Link Activity**: Visual indication during disc communication
- **Power State Changes**: Feedback when toggling CDP-CX355 power
- **Error States**: Distinctive patterns for communication failures

### S-Link Protocol Implementation

#### Command Structure
The Sony S-Link (Control-A1) protocol uses specific addressing and timing:

```cpp
// Device addressing for CDP-CX355
0x90 - CDP unit 1 (discs 1-200)
0x93 - CDP unit 2 (discs 201-300)

// BCD encoding for disc numbers
toBCD(8) = 0x08    // Disc 8
toBCD(99) = 0x99   // Disc 99
0x9A + (n-100)     // Discs 100+ (0x9A = disc 100, 0x9B = disc 101, etc.)
```

#### Title Discovery Process
The auto-discovery feature implements sophisticated retry logic:

1. **Multiple Attempts**: Up to 5 rapid attempts with varying delays (2ms, 4ms, 6ms, 8ms, 10ms)
2. **Response Detection**: Looks for specific response pattern "98,40," indicating valid title data
3. **Data Parsing**: Extracts ASCII title from hexadecimal response stream
4. **Automatic Storage**: Saves discovered titles directly to EEPROM

#### Communication Timing
- **S-Link Speed**: 355 bps (Sony specification)
- **Command Timeout**: 3-5 seconds typical
- **Retry Intervals**: 100ms between attempts
- **Monitor Windows**: 0.2-3 seconds for response capture

### Debugging Tools

#### Serial Monitor Output
Comprehensive logging provides insight into all operations:

```
=== Sony CDP-CX355 S-Link Controller Starting ===
S-Link pin (2) initial state: HIGH
✓ S-Link line appears stable and pulled HIGH (good)
=== Querying title for disc 8 ===
Attempt 1: 98,40,8,48,6f,77,20,54,6f,20,54,72,61,69,6e,20
SUCCESS on attempt 1

```

#### Built-in Diagnostic Functions
The code includes several diagnostic functions accessible via serial commands:

- **testSLinkConnection()**: Tests physical S-Link connection integrity
- **testDeviceResponse()**: Verifies communication with CDP-CX355
- **testTitleCommand()**: Tests title query functionality
- **monitorSLinkTraffic()**: Captures S-Link traffic for analysis

#### Connection Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

**"S-Link line stuck LOW"**
- Check physical connection to CDP-CX355 S-Link port
- Verify ground connection between Arduino and CDP unit
- Ensure proper line protection (220Ω resistor + diode)

**"No response to commands"**
- Confirm CDP-CX355 is powered on and responsive
- Check S-Link pin assignment (default: pin 2)
- Verify device addressing (0x90 for primary unit)

**"Title discovery fails"**
- Ensure disc is actually loaded in the specified slot
- Try manual disc selection on CDP unit first
- Check for S-Link timing issues in serial monitor

### Performance Optimization

#### Memory Management
- **Progressive Loading**: Prevents memory overflow with large disc collections
- **EEPROM Efficiency**: Optimized record structure minimizes storage overhead
- **Buffer Management**: Dynamic allocation prevents memory fragmentation

#### Network Optimization  
- **Pagination**: Reduces HTTP response sizes for better performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses TCP connections where possible
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents hanging connections

#### S-Link Optimization
- **Command Batching**: Groups related operations to minimize protocol overhead
- **Response Caching**: Avoids redundant queries where possible
- **Timing Adaptation**: Adjusts retry timings based on device responsiveness

### Security Considerations

#### Network Security
- **Local Network Only**: Device operates on local network, not internet-exposed
- **No Authentication**: Basic implementation assumes trusted local network
- **HTTP Only**: Uses unencrypted HTTP (suitable for local use)

#### Physical Security
- **S-Link Interface**: Direct hardware connection to CDP-CX355
- **EEPROM Storage**: Data persists locally on Arduino hardware
- **No External Dependencies**: Operates independently without cloud services

### Integration Possibilities

#### Home Automation
The REST API enables integration with home automation systems:

```bash

curl -X POST http://arduino-ip/ -d "command=bulkUpdate&disc=5"
curl http://arduino-ip/discs?page=1&limit=10
```

#### Custom Applications
