    <h1>S-Link CD Player Command Reference</h1>
    <i>Last Update: April 7, 2004</i>
    <hr>
    <br>
    This command list has been generated by trial and error with S-Link (Control-A1
    / Control-A1 II) equiped CD changers.  Listed are all the commands we have 
    seen generate either a coded response or some activity on the changers 
    themselves.  Commands identified as unknown generated gibberish as yet to be 
    deciphered or some other tell-tale response. The descriptions in this list are 
    a best guess since I don't have access to the actual specification.  All 
    constants are in hexadecimal unless otherwise noted. I've added notes where it 
    seemed necessary to clarify description, or data fields.  The general format 
    of a command is:
    <br><br>
    [device code] [command code] [extended data field(s)...]
    <br><br>
    <i>Note:</i> Unless the command expects a disc number, always use the lower
    device code (i.e. use 0x90, 0x91 or 0x93; not 0x94, 0x95 or 0x96).
    <p>
    If you find a mistake or learn something new, I'd love to hear about it.
    I'm especially interested in experiments with devices other than CD
    changers.  Happy hunting.

    Based on the original version of this document by 
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515230656/mailto:jbehle@earthling.net">Jeff</a> and
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515230656/mailto:behlendorf@comcast.net">Brian</a> with significant additions by
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515230656/mailto:peter_slink@maubp.freeserve.co.uk">Peter</a>.  The document is 
    now a compilation of our experiments and <a href="creditwheredue.html">other 
    web sources</a>.
    </p><p>
    A lot of the commands and responses are only supported on the later players.
    However, this is not very important if you want to control everything from a
    computer and display all the information on your monitor.
    </p><p>
    We would like to build up a list of which models support which commands -
    if you can help by testing our work, please get in touch.  In particular,
    we would like to know what the 0x22 query capacity command returns for
    different models.  The returned 0x61 message includes a byte of data which
    may encode what level of features the deck supports.
