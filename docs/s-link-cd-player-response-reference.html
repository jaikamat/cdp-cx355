    <h1>S-Link CD Player Response Reference</h1>
    <i>Last Update: December 8, 2005</i>
    <hr>
    <br>
    This command list has been generated by trial and error with S-Link (Control-A1
    / Control-A1 II) equiped
    CD changers.  Listed are all the commands we have seen generate either a
    coded response or some activity on the changers themselves.  Commands
    identified as unknown generated gibberish as yet to be deciphered or some 
    other tell-tale response. The descriptions in this list are a best guess since I
    don't have access to the actual specification.  All constants are in hexadecimal
    unless otherwise noted. I've added notes where it seemed necessary to clarify
    description, or data fields.  The general format of a response is:
    <br><br>
    [device code] [response code] [extended data field(s)...]
    <br><br>
    If you find a mistake or learn something new, I'd love to hear about it.
    I'm especially interested in experiments with devices other than CD
    changers.  Happy hunting.
    <p>
    Based on the original version of this document by 
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070704164051/mailto:jbehle@earthling.net">Jeff</a> and
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070704164051/mailto:behlendorf@comcast.net">Brian</a> with significant additions by
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070704164051/mailto:peter_slink@maubp.freeserve.co.uk">Peter</a>. This document is
    now a compilation of our experiments, 
    <a href="creditwheredue.html">other web sources</a>, and the many hundreds of
    helpful emails from people all over the world. Thanks go out to everyone for
    the help and feedback.
    </p><p>
    A lot of the commands and responses are only supported on the later players.
    However, this is not very important if you want to control everything from
    a computer and display all the information on your monitor.
    </p><p>
    We would like to build up a list of which models support which commands -
    if you can help by testing our work, please get in touch.  In particular,
    we would like to know what the 0x22 query capacity command returns for
    different models.  The returned 0x61 message includes a byte of data which
    may encode what level of features the deck supports.
