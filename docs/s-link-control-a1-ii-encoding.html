    <i>Last Update: February 2, 2003</i><hr><br>
    <p>
    </p><h2>Control-A1, Control-A1 II, and S-Link</h2>
    Control-A1 (sometimes called S-Link) and Control-A1 II use a serial protocol to
    transmit and recieve command codes to component audio systems.  This scheme is
    used for both S-Link style packets of 2 to ?? bytes, and the 16, 19, or 24 bit
    infrared legacy remote command codes.  
    <p>
    Briefly, the history of these specificiations runs something like this. The
    legacy command sequences are based on infrared remote commands and the early
    cable remote standard Control-S (see below). In the late 90's Sony introduced
    Control-A1 calling it S-Link for marketing purposes. Control-A1 appeared as
    part of a total system integration scheme which allowed an AV amplifier to act
    as a central command center for all equipment and present menus on a 
    television. Generally speaking this concept flopped for Sony simply because it
    was supported in only a limited way and few people rushed out to replace all
    their audio components with S-Link versions.  Control-A1 carried on however
    as a wonderful way to interact with large CD changers.  Control-A1 II was 
    introduced as a revision to the Control-A1 standard to provide support for
    CD changers with 300 discs or more. All Control-A1 commands work on devices
    using the Control-A1 II interface, but not necessarily the other way around.
    </p><p>
    Thus, we have a standard, which is proprietary to Sony and completely 
    undocumented in the public arena. Our jouney might have ended there, but 
    thanks to the tireless efforts of people who bought Sony equipment and actually
    wanted to use it, most everything about Control-A1 and Control-A1 II has been
    teased out of the machines themselves. You could glean how the encoding works 
    by reading the 
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070702173101/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/driverdownload.html">driver 
    source code</a>, but if that seems intimidating, never fear. We thought it 
    would be helpful to spell it out in case someone wants to start from scratch 
    (or work under a different platform).
    </p><p>
    The serial bus used for the Control-A1 / Control-A1 II by Sony equipment 
    operates in a steady hi state (+5 volts) when not sending data.  So the
    transmission of information consists of an arrangement of ground (0 volt) 
    pulses of various lengths.  The <a href="slinkhardware.html"> parallel port 
    adapter</a> described in these pages can be used to decode and send these 
    pulses by using the system interrupt generated when the bus transitions between
    high (+5 V) to low (ground) states.  The serial scheme chosen by Sony has 
    three elements:
    </p><p>
    <table width="75%">
    <tbody><tr>
    <td><li>An initialization pulse which is sent at the beginning of each serial 
    string to announce the traffic and help distinguish the data pulses from 
    potential bus noise.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/initpulse.gif"><br>Ground for 2400<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td><li>A pulse representing a binary one.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/onepulse.gif"><br>Ground for 1200<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td><li>A pulse representing a binary zero.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/zeropulse.gif"><br>Ground for 600<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
    </p><p> 
    Every pulse is seperated by a 600 microsecond "gap" where the bus returns to 
    +5 volts.  It has been my experience that the equipment behaves much like good 
    hardware should and the precisions required for transmission of this data are 
    fairly strict.
    </p><p>
    <i>Note: This is one of the main reason for the high processor speed required 
        for sending data using the parallel port.  On PC/AT type computers 
        (and most home computing hardware in general), there is a system 
        interrupt which must run frequently to keep the system running.  It is 
        impossible (and unwise in any event) to disable this operation and
        claim total control of the system.  As a result this interrupt WILL 
        OCCUR while transmitting data using the parallel port.  On machines 
        slower than pentium class handling multiple users (linux), occasionally
        the interrupt takes enough time to mangle a packet.  The result is 
            a meaningless data packet and essentially a missed message.</i>
    </p><p>
    As a simple example, to send an ASCII letter A, 0x41 hex / 65 decimal, using theControl-A1 / Control-A1 II serial format you would send: 
    <br><img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/slinka.gif">
    <br>
    init 0100 0001
    </p><p>
    Sending longer strings does not require resending the init pulse.  In fact, 
    resending the init will invalidate the string.  So to send a Control-A1 play
    command to CD player 1, the correct sequence is:
    <br><img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/slinkCD1play.gif">
    <br>
    init 1001 0000 0000 0000
    </p><p>
    To send a play using the infrared command set to CD player 2 you would transmit:
    <br><img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/irCD2play.gif">
    <br>
    init 1110 0100 1101 0011 100
    </p><p>
    The hardware I have appears to avoid the problem of two devices talking at the same time by a "wait-and-see" method.  If there
    is traffic on the bus, the equipment won't start sending it's message until things have been quiet for 2,000 microseconds.
    This may be a wait definined in the protocol specification or it may not, but it is how my equipment behaves and it seems to
    work out well when I use it in the device driver. 
    </p><p>
    </p><h2>Control-S</h2>
    Control-S is simply a TTL version of the SIRCS (Serial Infrared Remote Control
    Standard) and is encoded completely opposite the newer bussed Control-A1 
    standard. Control-S operates in a standard floating ground state (0 volts give 
    or take a volt). So the transmission of information consists of an arrangement
    of TTL hi pulses (+5 Volts). The
    <a href="slinkhardware.html"> parallel port adapter</a> described in these 
    pages can be used send these pulses by toggling the parallel port data bits.
    In principle a single Control-S data channel could also be monitored with a
    little design change, but the simple adapter currently presented on these 
    pages has not been designed for this purpose and is restricted to sending
    Control-S only.
    <p>
    <table width="75%">
    <tbody><tr>
    <td><li>An initialization pulse which is sent at the beginning of each serial 
    string to announce the traffic and help distinguish the data pulses from 
    potential bus noise.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/csinitpulse.gif"><br>+5 V for 2400<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td><li>A pulse representing a binary one.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/csonepulse.gif"><br>+5 V for 1200<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td><li>A pulse representing a binary zero.</li></td>
    <td align="CENTER">
    <img src="/web/20070702173101im_/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/cszeropulse.gif"><br>+5 V for 600<br>microseconds</td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
    </p><p> 
    Every pulse is seperated by a 600 microsecond "gap" where the bus returns to 
    0 volts. Command words are 12, 15 or 20 bits long and are made up of a 5, 8 
    or 13 bit device code and a 7 bit command code. Total message length is always 
    45 ms including the initialization pulse and all data bits. Each message must
    also be sent a minimum of three times. The repetition is a form of error 
    correction built into the SIRCS standard.  For practical purposes the message 
    length this is just a minimum command spacing on the Control-S bus since 
    messages are padded with the TTL low state.

    Hopefully I've managed to explain everything adequately to get everyone on with
    making neat stuff to communicate with their Sony equipment.  If all of this is too much for you, I recommend just using the 
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070702173101/http://www.undeadscientist.com/slink/driverdownload.html">
    device driver</a> which has been tested and works quite well.  If anyone is 
    still confused let me know and I'll do what I can to clear things up. Have 
    fun. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070702173101/mailto:jbehle@earthling.net">-Jeff</a><br></p><hr><br>
