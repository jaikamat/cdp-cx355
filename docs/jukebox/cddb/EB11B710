EXTD=Design of a Decade: 1986/1996 is a misleading title. The bulk of Janet 
EXTD=Jackson's greatest hits collection concentrates on Control and Rhythm N
EXTD=ation 1814, simply by contractual necessity. That is far from a fatal f
EXTD=law. The hits from those two albums were state-of-the-art dance-pop pro
EXTD=ductions at the time of their release, filled with bottomless beats and
EXTD= memorable, catchy hooks. None of the songs have lost any of their impa
EXTD=ct, from the funk of "Miss You Much" and "What Have You Done for Me Lat
EXTD=ely" to the ballads "Let's Wait Awhile" and "Come Back to Me." In addit
EXTD=ion to all 13 Top 40 hits from Control and Rhythm Nation -- all but one
EXTD= went into the Top Five -- Design of a Decade includes the biggest and 
EXTD=best hit from janet., the sultry "That's the Way Love Goes," and two ne
EXTD=w songs, "Runaway" and "Twenty Foreplay." It's a credit to Janet Jackso
EXTD=n that the two new numbers feel like genuine hits, not tacked-on filler
EXTD=, and help make the album a compulsively listenable greatest hits colle

EXTD=s: \n   \nDESIGN OF A DECADE 1986/1996 is a greatest-hits album with tw
EXTD=o new tracks: "Runaway" and "Twenty Foreplay."\n\nPersonnel includes: J
EXTD=anet Jackson (vocals); Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis (various instruments, bac
EXTD=kground vocals); Mike Scott, Nuno Bettencourt (guitar); Caroline Daws, 
EXTD=Brenda Mickens, Helen Foli, Dick Massman, Laurie Hippen, Julia Persitz,

EXTD=Josh Koestenbaum, Laura Sewell (cello); Ken Holmen (flute); Greg Hippen
EXTD= (bass); Stokley (drums); Fred McFarlane, Alan Friedman (programming); 
EXTD=Jerome Benton, Jellybean Johnson (background vocals).\n\nPricipally rec
EXTD=orded at Flyte Tyme Studios, Edina, Minnesota. Includes liner notes by 
EXTD=David Ritz.\n\nNeed to replace your worn-out copies of CONTROL and RHYT
EXTD=HM NATION 1814? DESIGN OF A DECADE is the two-for-one answer, whittling
EXTD= those two '80s R&B landmarks down to their thirteen blockbuster hits, 
EXTD=adding the 1993 single "That's The Way Love Goes" and two new tracks. I
EXTD=t's one beat-crazy disc that will rival Madonna's THE IMMACULATE COLLEC
EXTD=TION as the essential document of female pop of the '80s.\n\nJanet Jack
EXTD=son's solo career began in 1982, but it didn't really take off until 19
EXTD=86. CONTROL left everything else behind. The title track is a declarati
EXTD=on of independence that explicitly dismissed her famous parents and her
EXTD= brief marriage to James DeBarge. In doing so, Jackson launched her mus
EXTD=ic inexorably forward. CONTROL's songs are bottom-heavy, keyboard-contr
EXTD=olled blasts of electronic pop that shook off her family's sweet soul i
EXTD=n favor of the raw funk feel and steely techno sound of modern clubland
EXTD=. They continued the mid-'80s pop revolution started by brother Michael
EXTD= and Prince, and added an unmistakable feminist stamp. Yet the revoluti
EXTD=on also allowed such pillowy pop moments as "Let's Wait Awhile," an app
EXTD=arent ode to virginity. RHYTHM NATION--from which seven of this compila
EXTD=tion's tracks are drawn--went even further, blowing up the music's funk
EXTD=y bottom and adding shots of heavy-metal guitar and heavy-mental social
EXTD= conscience.\n\nDESIGN OF A DECADE begins and ends with new recordings.
EXTD= "Twenty Foreplay," a demand for total devotion from her lover, is a ba
EXTD=llad on which Jackson sounds eerily like her brother, except in her sex
EXTD=ual frankness. "Runaway" is a breezy, xylophone-driven pop tune that ma
EXTD=y seem like a retreat from her funkiest advances; then again, it may be
EXTD= just one more stretch in Janet Jackson's universal pop ambitions. \n--
